            <p>Founded 1994 by the Trustees of Deeper Christian Life Ministry we started our way as a private <a href="../subsites/nursery.html">Nursery School</a> on our campus in Daressalaam Sinza. The popularity of our education center grew very fast and so we had the chance to expand establishing a <a href="../subsites/primary.html">Primary School</a> in 1997 on the same Campus. But the demand for an ongoing school appeared quickly. After a year in the Dar-Campus, we decided in 2006 to move the <a href="../subsites/secondary.html">Secondary School</a>, now as a boarding only school out to Zinga where our students can learn in a calm and focused athmosphere surrounded by the nature.</p>
